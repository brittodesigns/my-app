# Directory Application - Screen Structure

## ðŸ“± Application Flow

Based on the requirements document, I've created a complete mobile directory application with the following user flow:

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
- **Login Screen** (`/auth/login.tsx`)
  - Mobile number input with validation
  - Send OTP functionality
  - Clean, modern UI with proper error handling

- **OTP Verification Screen** (`/auth/verify-otp.tsx`)
  - 6-digit OTP input with auto-focus
  - Timer countdown (2 minutes)
  - Resend OTP functionality
  - Auto-navigation to next screen

### 2. **Company Selection**
- **Company Selection Screen** (`/company-selection.tsx`)
  - Card-based layout showing available companies
  - Company logo, name, and description
  - Visual selection state
  - Continue button to proceed

### 3. **User Directory**
- **User Directory Screen** (`/user-directory.tsx`)
  - Paginated user list with search functionality
  - Search by name, role, or department
  - Sort options (by name or department)
  - Pull-to-refresh and infinite scroll
  - Clean card-based user items

### 4. **User Profile**
- **User Profile Screen** (`/user-profile.tsx`)
  - Complete user profile with high-res image
  - Contact actions (Call, Message, Email)
  - Detailed information sections:
    - Contact Information
    - Professional Information
    - Personal Information
  - One-tap contact functionality

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Features

### **Modern UI/UX**
- Clean, professional design
- Consistent color scheme (#007AFF primary)
- Proper spacing and typography
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive layouts

### **User Experience**
- Intuitive navigation flow
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Proper loading indicators
- Error messages and validation
- Smooth transitions between screens

### **Accessibility**
- Proper touch targets
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Readable fonts and contrast
- Logical tab order

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Navigation Structure**
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx (Root layout with all screens)
â”œâ”€â”€ (tabs)/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx (Welcome screen with auto-redirect)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ explore.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ verify-otp.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ company-selection.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ user-directory.tsx
â””â”€â”€ user-profile.tsx
```

### **Key Features Implemented**
- âœ… Mobile number authentication flow
- âœ… OTP verification with timer
- âœ… Company selection with card layout
- âœ… Searchable and sortable user directory
- âœ… Pagination with infinite scroll
- âœ… Detailed user profiles
- âœ… One-tap contact actions (Call, Message, Email)
- âœ… Proper navigation structure
- âœ… Loading states and error handling
- âœ… Modern, responsive UI

### **API Integration Points**
The screens are ready for backend integration with the following endpoints:
- `POST /auth/send-otp` - Send OTP to mobile number
- `POST /auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP and get JWT token
- `GET /companies/available` - Get user's associated companies
- `GET /companies/:company_id/users` - Get paginated user list
- `GET /users/:user_id` - Get detailed user profile

### **Security Considerations**
- JWT token validation for all API calls
- Company-level access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for OTP requests
- Secure token storage (to be implemented)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Development

The application structure is complete and ready for:
1. Backend API integration
2. Firebase Authentication setup
3. Real data implementation
4. Testing and deployment

All screens follow the requirements specification and provide a solid foundation for the directory application.
